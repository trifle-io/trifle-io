# Personal Website

*Link*: [vaclavik.me](https://vaclavik.me) 

For a long time my personal website has been build using Hugo and deployed through Github Actions. This created very easy workflow to simply creating new file throubh Github, saving it and seeing it live withing couple minutes.

I would be bit of hypocrite if I wouldn't build my own website using `Trifle::Docs`. Am I right?

The experience of building it has been actually quite refreshing. I've been using somewhat customized Hugo template LoveIt with colors and fots as I prefered them. But I could never really tweaked the theme to match my liking. There were always things here or there that were not up to my taste.

Moving to `Trifle::Docs` gave me full flexibility over template and content on the pages. I still have landing page section, still have blog with different posts, and now I have also list of projects. It's 2025 and deploying simple Sinatra App to something like [Fly.io](https://fly.io) is as easy as a pie.

It's not much, but for me its plenty. As much as I love static pages, having the ability to hit ruby code gives me more freedom to do additional functionality later on. Like collecting emails for mailing list. Or some other weird stuff that I probably will never do. But you, I could.
