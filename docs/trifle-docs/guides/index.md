# How to Guides

Pick a common task and follow the guide:

- [Render Menu](/trifle-docs/guides/menu)
- [Table of Content](/trifle-docs/guides/toc)
- [Nested Documents](/trifle-docs/guides/nested)
- [Next & Previous Documents](/trifle-docs/guides/neighbour)

Each guide assumes you already have `sitemap`, `collection`, and `meta` available in your templates.
