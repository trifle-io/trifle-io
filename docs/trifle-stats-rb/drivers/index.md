# Driver

Driver is a wrapper class that persists and retrieves values from backend. It needs to implement:

- `inc(keys:, **values)` method increment values for keys
- `set(keys:, **values)` method set values for keys
- `ping(key:, **values)` method that sets values for key and updates timestamp
- `get(keys:)` method to retrieve values for keys
- `scan(key:)` method that looks up for last ping received for a key

The keys array to build identifiers for objects that needs to modify or retrieve values for. Driver then decides on the optimal way to implement these actions.

## Feature Parity

Not all databases support same functionality. While it is important to keep these as close as possible, some features are not reasonable to achieve in some databases. Here is matrix of these drivers.

| Driver   | prefix | collection_name | joined_identifiers | expire_after |
|----------|--------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------|
| Redis    | YES    | NO              | NO                 | YES          |
| Postgres | NO     | YES             | YES                | NO           |
| Mongo    | NO     | YES             | YES                | YES          |
| Sqlite   | NO     | YES             | YES                | NO           |
| Process  | NO     | NO              | NO                 | NO           |
| Dummy    | WTF    | WTF             | WTF                | WTF          |

Features like [`Beam`](./usage/beam) and [`Scan`](./usage/scan) require `joined_identifiers: false` configuration and while it is not required, you want to expire this data otherwise it will polute your database quickly.

## Performance

Here you have a rough estimate in performance over different drivers running on very basic `t3.small` EC2 instance.

```sh
root@3b5545595714:~/trifle-stats/spec/performance# ruby run.rb 1000 '{"a":1,"b":2,"c":{"d":3,"e":{"f":4,"g":5}}}'
Testing 1000x {"a"=>1, "b"=>2, "c"=>{"d"=>3, "e"=>{"f"=>4, "g"=>5}}}

```

Use that to make up your mind in what you're looking for. You can read more in [performance](./drivers/performance) to find which database will fit your usecase the best.

Hope Feature Parity and Performance will help you make a decision when choosing the right database for your `Trifle::Stats`.


## Packer Mixin

Some databases cannot store nested hashes/values. Or they cannot perform increment on nested values that does not exist. For this reason you can use Packer mixin that helps you convert values to dot notation.

```ruby
class Sample
  include Trifle::Stats::Mixins::Packer
end

values = { a: 1, b: { c: 22, d: 33 } }
=> {:a=>1, :b=>{:c=>22, :d=>33}}

packed = Sample.pack(hash: values)
=> {"a"=>1, "b.c"=>22, "b.d"=>33}

Sample.unpack(hash: packed)
=> {"a"=>1, "b"=>{"c"=>22, "d"=>33}}
```
